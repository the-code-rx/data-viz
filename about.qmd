## This visualization dashboard serves two primary tasks:
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Users delve into an unknown heart disease dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and potential relationships without prior assumptions, generating new hypotheses.

- **Confirmatory Analysis:** Users then test and validate these hypotheses using statistical methods to assess the significance and strength of the identified relationships.

- **Survey:** Please take the survey to share your thoughts and feedback about the visualization dashboard and how we can improve it and how well it accomplished these tasks.
